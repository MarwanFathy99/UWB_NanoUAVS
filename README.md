# UWB_NanoUAVS
## This Project was a semester Project at ETH ZÃ¼rich, the project goal was to localise Nano Drones equipped with UWB Nodes using a particle filter.

### The file descriptions are the following
* Sim.ipynb simulates the Particle Filter, it was first used as a proof of concept
* particle_filter.h/c have all the functions used for the particle filter during flight
* trajectory.c calculates the next point (coordinates x and y) in the trajectory of the drone according to the Particle filter's results.
